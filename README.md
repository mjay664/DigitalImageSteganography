# DigitalImageSteganography
A fun project. This project was developed in python 2.7 using PyCharm Community Edition IDE. The algorithm takes image, key and message. The goal is to hide message in the image. First message is converted into bits. Each bit of message is stored in the least 8-bits of 32 bit pixel representation. First pixel at which first bit of message is to be stored is chosen using key. After that image is divided in four parts. At which part next bit of message will be stored will be decided using key and current pixel location(quadrant) and coordinates of the pixel are also derived from key and current pixel intensity. Output image pixels will be in RGBA representation and image format will be PNG.
After hiding each bit of message key is also updated to a new key that is derived from current key and current pixel intensity. Algorithm works efficiently if image is atleast of 512X512. In 512X512 image we can hide upto 1000 character long message including spaces.
